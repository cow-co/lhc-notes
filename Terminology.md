# Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|  --- |   ---   |
| AFS | Active filling scheme. Describes (in an arcane manner) how exactly the particle batches are arranged in the beams |
| AGK | Abort Gap Keeper. Ensures that the abort gap (the particle-free gap that ensures no losses are suffered during rise-time of the extraction magnets) is maintained |
| BBLR | Beam-Beam Long-Range interactions. Electromagnetic interactions between the beams, arising because they share a vacuum cavity |
| Beta* | The distance from the interaction point, at which the beam is twice as wide as at the IP |
| BIS | Beam interlock system. "[T]he backbone of the beam related protection" |
| BLM | Beam loss monitor. Keeps an eye on the beam loss systems |
| BPL | Beam Phase Loop. "[D]esigned to keep the bunches in the centre of the RF bucket" (Argyropoulos and Timko, *LHC Longitudinal Dynamics* (2020)) |
| BRAN | Bean RAte of Neutrals - "monitor the energy deposited by electromagnetic showers produced by high-energy neutral particles from the collisions" (Matis *et al.*, *The BRAN luminosity detectors for the LHC" (2016)) |
| IP/IR | Interaction point/Interaction region (P1: ATLAS (in between the beam injection sites), P2: ALICE, P5: CMS, P8: LHCb). Other points are P3: cleaning, P4: RF, P6: dump, P7: cleaning. |
| LS | Long Shutdown |
| MKD | Extraction kicker magnets |
| MKI | Injection kicker magnets |
| P1 | Point 1 (where ATLAS is) |
| PM | Post mortem |
| PS (aka. CPS) | Proton Synchrotron |
| QPS | Quench Protection System |
| Quench | When the superconducting magnets rise in temperature to the point where they are no longer super-conducting (ie. they become resistive) |
| S## | Sector ##. There are eight sectors in the LHC ring, named after the Points they run between (eg. S56 runs from P5 to P6 - ie. from CMS to beam dump point) |
| SPS | Super Proton Synchrotron |
| TDI | Target Dump Injection. Located at points 2 and 8. Protects the machine from off-trajectory beams injected from SPS. |
| vdM Scan | van der Meer scan. Used for doing luminosity measurements |
| YETS | Year-End Technical Stop |
