# Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|  --- |   ---   |
| ADT | Transverse Damper. Damps transverse (hori/verti) oscillations in the beam, to try to keep it to the ideal trajectory. |
| AFS | Active filling scheme. Describes (in an arcane manner) how exactly the particle batches are arranged in the beams |
| AGK | Abort Gap Keeper. Ensures that the abort gap (the particle-free gap that ensures no losses are suffered during rise-time of the extraction magnets) is maintained |
| BBLR | Beam-Beam Long-Range interactions. Electromagnetic interactions between the beams, arising because they share a vacuum cavity |
| Beta* | The distance from the interaction point, at which the beam is twice as wide as at the IP |
| BIS | Beam interlock system. "[T]he backbone of the beam related protection" |
| BLM | Beam loss monitor. Keeps an eye on the beam loss systems |
| BPL | Beam Phase Loop. "[D]esigned to keep the bunches in the centre of the RF bucket" (Argyropoulos and Timko, *LHC Longitudinal Dynamics* (2020)) |
| BPM | Beam Position Monitor |
| BRAN | Beam RAte of Neutrals - "monitor the energy deposited by electromagnetic showers produced by high-energy neutral particles from the collisions" (Matis *et al.*, *The BRAN luminosity detectors for the LHC" (2016)) |
| Collimator | A large jaw made of tungsten or graphite, which capture stray particles |
| IP/IR | Interaction point/Interaction region (P1: ATLAS (in between the beam injection sites), P2: ALICE, P5: CMS, P8: LHCb). Other points are P3: cleaning, P4: RF, P6: dump, P7: cleaning. |
| LBDS | LHC Beam Dump System |
| LINAC | Linear Accelerator. Where protons for LHC are generated. |
| LS | Long Shutdown |
| MB | Main bending magnet |
| MKD | Dump (extraction) kicker magnets |
| MKI | Injection kicker magnets |
| MQD | Main Defocusing Quadrupole magnet |
| MQF | Main Focusing Quadrupole magnet | 
| MSD | Dump (extraction) septum magnets |
| P1 | Point 1 (where ATLAS is) |
| PM | Post mortem |
| PS (aka. CPS) | Proton Synchrotron |
| PSB | Proton Synchrotron Booster (comes after the LINAC but before the PS) | 
| QPS | Quench Protection System |
| Quench | When the superconducting magnets rise in temperature to the point where they are no longer super-conducting (ie. they become resistive) |
| Roman Pot | Measures the total cross-section of two beams |
| RQF/RQD/RB | The circuits for MQF/MQD/MB, respectively. Seem to be named after the sector they run along (e.g. RB.A12 might run between P1 and P2) |
| S## | Sector ##. There are eight sectors in the LHC ring, named after the Points they run between (eg. S56 runs from P5 to P6 - ie. from CMS to beam dump point) |
| SBDS | SPS Beam Dump System |
| Splash | A type of event that occurs when the beam is intentionally impacted against a collimator near a detector - often used for testing the detectors |
| SPS | Super Proton Synchrotron |
| TDE | Target Dump External. The main beam dumps. |
| TDI | Target Dump Injection. Located at points 2 and 8. Protects the machine from off-trajectory beams injected from SPS. |
| TI2/TI8 | Transfer injection lines at points 2 (beam 1) and 8 (beam 2) |
| vdM Scan | van der Meer scan. Used for doing luminosity measurements |
| XRP | Roman pot |
| YETS | Year-End Technical Stop |
