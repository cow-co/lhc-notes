# More In-Depth Explanations

## Injections

- The LHC beams originate in the LINACs (LINear ACcelerators)
- The beams cannot be continuous, since there must be gaps to allow kicker magnets (the magnets which transfer the beam from one line to another) to rise to full strength
- Therefore, there is a bunch --> batch --> injection --> fill structure
- The LINAC generates *bunches* of protons
- The bunches are grouped into a *batch*. The bunches in a batch are separated by (now) 25ns, though it used to be 50ns - this is the rise time of the kickers from the LINAC to the PSB
- The batches are then formed (with gaps between them of somewhere in the region of 250ns) into an injection, to the SPS
- The injections are then sent to the LHC, with gaps between them of about 900ns
- If multiple fills are needed, then they must be separated by the abort gap (~3Î¼s) 

## Beam Dump

- The beams are highly energetic, and can generate intense radiation on impact with materials
- As such, it is imperative that they can be stopped safely
- This is the purpose of the beam dump system
- Beam dump starts with MKDs kicking the beam out horizontally
- The MSD then shifts the beam vertically
- The beam now goes through a series of horizontal and vertical magnets, which spin the beam out in an "e" shape
- The beam width itself also widens
- The beam travels through a roughly 600m-long straight tunnel
- The beam then impacts a multiple-metre-long solid block of graphite, encased in a steel container
- The impact point heats to between 1000-1500 Celsius (depending on which Run we're looking at)
- People aren't allowed in, because of the immense radiation generated, but if they were then they'd hear a very loud bang/bell noise of the rapid thermal expansion/contraction of the dump target materials
- The dump targets have become so radioactive that, instead of removing them to be replaced, the LHC engineers are simply using the spares as the new HL-LHC dump targets and leaving the old ones be 

## Beam Setup Process

- The process of setting up for a physics beam starts with SPS injections at 450GeV
- Pilot injections are used to verify things like collimators and so on
- Once verified, a physics fill is injected
- The beam is then ramped up in intensity and energy, to a flat top
- The beams are then squeezed to the required beta*
- Collisions then commence
