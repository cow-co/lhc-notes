# Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|  --- |   ---   |
| ADT | Transverse Damper. Damps transverse (hori/verti) oscillations in the beam, to try to keep it to the ideal trajectory. |
| AFS | Active filling scheme. Describes (in an arcane manner) how exactly the particle batches are arranged in the beams |
| AGK | Abort Gap Keeper. Ensures that the abort gap (the particle-free gap that ensures no losses are suffered during rise-time of the extraction magnets) is maintained |
| BBLR | Beam-Beam Long-Range interactions. Electromagnetic interactions between the beams, arising because they share a vacuum cavity |
| Beta* | The distance from the interaction point, at which the beam is twice as wide as at the IP |
| BIS | Beam interlock system. "[T]he backbone of the beam related protection" |
| BLM | Beam loss monitor. Keeps an eye on the beam loss systems |
| BPL | Beam Phase Loop. "[D]esigned to keep the bunches in the centre of the RF bucket" (Argyropoulos and Timko, *LHC Longitudinal Dynamics* (2020)) |
| BPM | Beam Position Monitor |
| BRAN | Beam RAte of Neutrals - "monitor the energy deposited by electromagnetic showers produced by high-energy neutral particles from the collisions" (Matis *et al.*, *The BRAN luminosity detectors for the LHC" (2016)) |
| Collimator | A large jaw made of tungsten or graphite, which capture stray particles |
| Crystals | Bent crystals are used to clean the halos (off-trajectory particles) off the beams, by channeling the halo particles into the collimators |
| DS[L or R] | Dispersion Suppressor [Left or Right] - part of the collimation system | 
| IP/IR | Interaction point/Interaction region (P1: ATLAS (in between the beam injection sites), P2: ALICE, P5: CMS, P8: LHCb). Other points are P3: cleaning, P4: RF, P6: dump, P7: cleaning. |
| LBDS | LHC Beam Dump System |
| LINAC | Linear Accelerator. Where protons for LHC are generated. |
| LS | Long Shutdown |
| LSS | Long Straight Section - part of the machine; self-explanatory. IRs/Points lie within these. |
| MB | Main bending magnet |
| MKD | Dump (extraction) kicker magnets |
| MKI | Injection kicker magnets |
| MQD | Main Defocusing Quadrupole magnet |
| MQF | Main Focusing Quadrupole magnet | 
| MSD | Dump (extraction) septum magnets |
| OMC | Optics Measurement and Corrections |
| P1 | Point 1 (where ATLAS is) |
| PM | Post mortem |
| PS (aka. CPS) | Proton Synchrotron |
| PSB | Proton Synchrotron Booster (comes after the LINAC but before the PS) | 
| QPS | Quench Protection System |
| Quench | When the superconducting magnets rise in temperature to the point where they are no longer super-conducting (ie. they become resistive) |
| Roman Pot | Measures the total cross-section of two beams |
| RQF/RQD/RB | The circuits for MQF/MQD/MB, respectively. Named after the sector they run along (e.g. RB.A12 runs between P1 and P2) |
| S## | Sector ##. There are eight sectors in the LHC ring, named after the Points they run between (eg. S56 runs from P5 to P6 - ie. from CMS to beam dump point) |
| SBDS | SPS Beam Dump System |
| Scrubbing | A process by which bunches are circulated in order to clean out "loose" electrons from the vacuum line |
| Splash | A type of event that occurs when the beam is intentionally impacted against a collimator near a detector - often used for testing the detectors |
| SPS | Super Proton Synchrotron |
| TCDQ | A graphite absorber ("diluter") block, placed in front of the Q4 magnet downstream of the beam dump in order to help protect against dumps that are not synced with the abort gap. Covers angles between the *TCS* and the *TCDS* |
| TCDS | Diluter blocks placed in front of the series of *MSD* magnets along the beam dump, in order to protect the *MSD*s from mistimed kicks | 
| TCLI[A/B] | Auxiliary injection collimators |
| TCS | A *collimator* placed downstream of the beam dump, in front of the Q4 magnet, to protect downstream components from slightly mistimed dump-kicks |
| TDE | Target Dump External. The main beam dumps. |
| TDI[S] | Target Dump Injection. Located at points 2 and 8. Protects the machine from off-trajectory beams injected from SPS. TDIS (S standing for "segmented") is an improved version, installed during LS2, designed for high lumi |
| TI2/TI8 | Transfer injection lines at points 2 (beam 1) and 8 (beam 2) |
| vdM Scan | van der Meer scan. Used for doing luminosity measurements |
| XRP | Roman pot |
| YETS | Year-End Technical Stop |
