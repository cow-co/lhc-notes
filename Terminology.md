| Term | Meaning |
|  --- |   ---   |
| AFS | Active filling scheme. Describes (in an arcane manner) how exactly the particle batches are arranged in the beams |
| AGK | Abort Gap Keeper. Ensures that the abort gap (the particle-free gap that ensures no losses are suffered during rise-time of the extraction magnets) is maintained |
| Beta* | The distance from the interaction point, at which the beam is twice as wide as at the IP |
| BIS | Beam interlock system. "[T]he backbone of the beam related protection" |
| BLM | Beam loss monitor. Keeps an eye on the beam loss systems |
| BRAN | Bean RAte of Neutrals - "monitor the energy deposited by electromagnetic showers produced by high-energy neutral particles from the collisions" (Matis *et al.*, *The BRAN luminosity detectors for the LHC" (2016)) |
| IP/IR | Interaction point/Interaction region |
| LS | Long Shutdown |
| MKD | Extraction kicker magnets |
| MKI | Injection kicker magnets |
| P1 | Point 1 (where ATLAS is) |
| PM | Post mortem |
| QPS | Quench Protection System |
| Quench | When the superconducting magnets rise in temperature to the point where they are no longer super-conducting (ie. they become resistive) |
| vdM Scan | van der Meer scan. Used for doing luminosity measurements |
| YETS | Year-End Technical Stop |
